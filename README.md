# Introduction

The output voltage in a power electronics converter can vary with a change in input voltage change in the load or changes in the duty cycle of the switching device. To obtain a constant output voltage, a controller is of the utmost importance. In many practical areas like PV solar plant input voltage varies significantly, this in turn will also make the output DC voltage, which is very undesirable.
